  abstract  = {This paper presents a robust optimization technique for the reconfigurable measurement of sensory electronics for Industry 4.0 to obtain a robust solution even in the presence of observer uncertainty using a cost-effective performance measurement method. The extrinsic evaluation of the proposed methodology is performed on an indirect current-feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA), which is a fundamental part of sensory systems. A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based approach is used to estimate uncertainty levels efficiently.}
